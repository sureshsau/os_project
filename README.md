🛡️ OS Security Vulnerability Detection and Mitigation Framework
    📋 Project Overview
    This project presents a framework to detect, simulate, and mitigate major security vulnerabilities in operating systems.
    It addresses threats such as Buffer Overflows, Trapdoors, and Cache Poisoning, providing real-time alerts, simulations of attacks, and           automated prevention strategies to strengthen system security.

🚀 Features
  🔥 Simulate common OS-level vulnerabilities:

    Buffer Overflow attacks

    Trapdoor exploits

    Cache Poisoning scenarios

🛡️ Real-time detection of suspicious activities

🛠️ Automated mitigation and recovery recommendations

📊 Attack logging and detailed reporting

🧰 Technologies Used
  Languages: Python / C
    
    Libraries & Tools:
    
    System calls and OS interfaces
    
    Sockets for network-based simulations
    
    Logging frameworks
    
    (Optional) Matplotlib for visual analytics

🛡️ Vulnerabilities Covered

Vulnerability	Description	Mitigation Techniques
    Buffer Overflow	Overwrites memory to execute malicious payloads	Stack canaries, input validation, ASLR
    Trapdoors (Backdoors)	Hidden access paths bypassing security mechanisms	Code reviews, system audits, access control
    Cache Poisoning	Manipulation of cached data for malicious use	Cache validation, signed caching mechanisms

📈 Future Enhancements
AI/ML integration for smarter anomaly detection

Extend framework for race conditions and privilege escalation detection

Web dashboard for real-time monitoring and visualization

Cloud integration for large-scale system security analysis
